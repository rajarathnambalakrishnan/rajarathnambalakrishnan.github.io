Hello, I'm Raja. I completed my Master of Engineering (M Eng) from `University of California - Berkeley`, in Industrial Engineering and Operations Research.

After the Masters program, I completed an year of Research Internship under the SCET, UC Berkeley.

I've worked on projects and research papers ranging from `Optimization` to `Deep Learning in AI`. I'm curious to explore `Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence` Research Areas.
